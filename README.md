## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer in Ann Arbor, MI. I'm deeply motivated by the opportunity to leverage technology for positive social change. After spending nine years devoted to improving educational experiences in underserved communities as an educator, I transitioned to software development to amplify my impact through technology.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working with Typescript, Node, React, Postgres, AWS & Heroku
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Next.js
